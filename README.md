Go library for card game development

####WIP
* Library
* Nicht die Bohn

####TODO
* seperate library and game logic, very messy atm
* fix rand seed setup so I can optionally generate new shuffles/games each runtime.
* log game actions to file, for checking of game logic
* lots of things should be interfaces, for further game dev: Shuffler, Player, Scorer?
* implement naive AI, instead of taking random cards, take the card that increases personal score the most, much further on: implement 'smart' AI, take the card that increases score delta by the most (vs. currently highest scoring player?)
